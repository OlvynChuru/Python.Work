# (a)
print(5 / 3)
# This prints 1.66666...
#  because division in Python returns a float number,
#  even if both things being divided are integers.

# (b)
print(5 % 3)
# This prints 2
#  because % is the modulus operator. 2 is the
#  remainder when 3 is taken out of 5
#  a maximum number of times.

# (c)
print(5.0 / 3)
# This prints 1.66666...
#  for the same reasons as in (a).

# (d)
print(5 / 3.0)
# This prints 1.66666...
#  for the same reasons as in (a) and (c).

# (e)
print(5.2 % 3)
# This prints 2.2
#  because 2.2 is the remainder when 3 is taken
#  out of 5.2 a maximum number of times.
